= Uyuni Documentation Content Repository

This is the content repository for the Uyuni documentation site.
These docs are built using the antora static site generator.
Antora utilizes a _playbook_ for building documentation.
This playbook is located in the following repository:

- https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs-publisher

Follow the instructions located at the **uyuni-docs-publisher** repo to generate the documentation site.
The generated site can be viewed in a browser or pushed to GitHub pages.

Currently we build from four branches:

* master
* maintenance/3.2
* include-test (temp testing repository for upcoming changes)
* ia-rework

In the near future the ia-rework branch will become master.
