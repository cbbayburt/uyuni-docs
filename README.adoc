This is the content repository for the Uyuni documentation site.
These docs are built using the antora static site generator.
Antora utilizes a _playbook_ for building documentation.
This playbook is located in the following repository:

- https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs-publisher

Follow the instructions located at the **uyuni-docs-publisher** repo to generate the documentation site.
The generated site can be viewed in a browser or pushed to GitHub pages.

Currently we build from three branches:

* master
* maintenance/3.2
* include-test (testing repository for upcoming changes)

In the future we will remove include-test, and begin the IA rework in the _IA-rework_ branch.
